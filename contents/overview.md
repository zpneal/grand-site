### Coverage
GRAND currently provides reporting guidelines for whole networks, ego networks, multimode networks (both N-partite and multilevel), and hypergraphs. Each of these types of networks may vary in many ways:
* Edges may be directed or undirected
* Edges may be weighted, unweighted, or signed
* Edges may be multiplex or simple
* Data may describe a single static network, multiple networks representing waves over time in a single system (e.g., T1, T2), or multiple networks representing similar systems (e.g., Team 1, Team 2; Ego 1, Ego 2)

Future versions of GRAND will provide guidance on other types of networks (e.g., continuous-time dynamic).
